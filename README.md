## Example usage

- Generate random sequence based on note X follows note Y frequencies in file `example.mid`
```console
$ ./midi/midi-get example.mid | ./random-markov-path 10 | ./key2music
A    6
C    6
A    6
B    6
C    7
C#   6
C#   6
D#   6
D#   6
B    5
B    5
```

## Programs

- `dur2frac.cc` - turns duration in number of 1/64 to more readable fraction
- `graph-markov.cc` - turns Markov chain described by TSV file into Graphviz DOT file
- `key2music.cc` - transforms key number into note and octave
- `midi/bigrams-dur.go` - transforms MIDI file into markov chain based on probability of occuring duration `X` for key `Y`
- `midi/bigrams-notes.go` - transforms MIDI file into markov chain based on probability of occuring key `X` after key `Y`
- `random-markov-path.cc` - takes length of path and produces sequence of keys based on probabilities in TSV
